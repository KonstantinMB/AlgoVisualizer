# AlgoVisualizer
This is one of my university projects. The task was to create a visualizer of the merge sort algorithm.

What I've leearned from coding here:
1. How to work with JPanel (painful) and implementing Graphics on it.
2. Better work with 2D and 3D arrays.
3. Implementing merge sort with auxiliary array + everything about this sorting algo :)

This is how the program works. The shuffle button changes the sizes of the elements randomly. The merge button merges all elements in sorted order.

The Length +, Length -, Speed +, Speed -, change the number of blocks and the speed of execution respectively.

You can also remove the Visualization of the Auxiliary Array by commenting out two lines of code, so  the result will look like this:

Contact me if you want to know how to remove the aux.array and make the visualization like on the last GIF.


Thank you for the support!
Feel free to copy the code and use it for your uni/school projects ;)
